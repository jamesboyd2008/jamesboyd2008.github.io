<ul>
	<li>What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?</li>  
	I learned that having a fluent understanding of what a  
	particular change to your CSS will do to your web page  
	can significantly expedite the development process.  

	<li>What did you learn about CSS positioning?</li>  
	As mentioned above, if I could play out my moves in CSS as if  
	I were playing chess, the whole web creation process would  
	go a lot smoother.  Adapting a website to function on multiple  
	platforms is going to prove key.  My page is not up to par  
	in that regard at this time.  

	<li>What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?</li>  
	Positioning seems to be where I am having the most trouble.  
	I am a wizard at setting font colors haha.  This exercise went  
	a lot smoother having come after the two pairing challenges.  

	<li>What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?</li>  
	I learned that I need to get a more functional understanding of  
	how each decision I make will impact the page.  For what it's worth,  
	using CSS did make this go quicker than it would have if all of  
	the stylization was being done in the HTML file.
