    What are the benefits of version control?
      Version control is a necessity for large web development projects.  Version control helps teams of programmers by recording changes made to files, enabling people to access past versions.  If everyone was working on the same file at the same time, things would get contradictory and too confusing.  Additionaly, if things go awry, one can simply revert to a past copy of a file, as if the bad things never happened.  Rudimentary methods of version control have been implemented for thousands of years.  Ancient hunters probably compared spear tips to the best spear tip in the group.  When a better spear tip was developed, they merged it into their concept of the ideal spear tip.  Obsidian arrowheads can be sharper than a scalpel.  How many versions of pointy-stick did people go through before they used volcanic glass? Cartographers have been comparing maps for hundreds of years.  Mariners/explorers would discover new terrain features, record them, and share those findings.  Every world map we have is a product of version control.  Laws also go through a version control process.  Version control may seem to be a concept birthed from software engineering, but it is as old as man.  Shoot, one may go so far as to say sexual reproduction is a method of version control.

      How does git help you keep track of changes?
         Git is a program that allows users to work on multiple versions of the same file.  Those versions can be submitted to peers for review, then merged into the master copy of the project.  People can work on different portions of a file at the same time, then combine them.  This saves a lot of time.  Also, you can see what changes were made and when they were made, which aids tremendously in troubleshooting.

      Why use GitHub to store your code?
        GitHub allows thousands of programmers to view/edit the source code for thousands of programs, enabling immense amounts of collaboration and increased productivity for free.  Other version control systems are not as popular and/or cost money.  If the benefits are not immediately clear, they will be when robots are doing all our chores.
